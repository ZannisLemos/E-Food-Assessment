# E-Food-Assessment
Senior Business Intelligence Analyst Main Assessment

Hello everyone!

A few words about my assessment :)

For the coding part of the assessment I have used the SQL Editor provided as a link in the word file.

For the visualization part of the assessment I have made a tableau dashboard (instructions below). Moreover i have made a powerpoint presentation with printscreens from the results, and a few comments for my findings.

Tableau installation instructions:

STEP 1:

Please follow the link  https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download in order to go to tableau main page.

STEP 2:

Then you have to enter your e-mail ID and click "Download the app" button.

STEP 3:

A tableaupublicdesktop.exe file will start downloading.

STEP 4:

After the download is complete, please open the exe file and click install. That's it :)
